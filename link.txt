I'm at a point where I am trying to run the tests. I don't think its working because the application starts running on port 5552 rather than 5551. I've tried checking to see if I have any other projects that are still running by going to http://localhost:5551/.  It says the site can't be reached and that I can't connect to that local host. My question is how do I connect on 5551 instead of 5552.

Other than not being able to run the tests, I think I have everything correct.

After using the command: npx live-server --port=5551, and then opening a second terminal, I was able to run the tests. At first the instructions said to only run that command if you are not working in vscode. Maybe they should say to just run the code anyway. I think my question still stands from above on how to make the Go Live button open on port 5551.
